### What did you do this past week?
This past week, I got all of the textbooks and tried to do the readings, as well read as the given articles. I also got started on the first project. 

### What's in your way?
I still need to practice Python, since I had never used it before this class. I also need to work on allocating time to complete all of the readings because they are quite lengthy, and some quiz questions are very specific.

### What will you do next week?
Now that I have a sense of what a complete week in this class feels like, I can better allocate my time for studying. This will definitely be most time consuming class of my semester.

### My experience in the class:
I was finally called on in class on the last day of the week, and it wasn't too bad! Professor Downing really helps you answer questions, and it's okay if you get them wrong. We spent a whole class just going over steps to take to do the project, which I am quite grateful for. The first project requires using many different technologies, which feels pretty overwhelming. I already regret not starting earlier. Also, I think the public test repo is pretty interesting. If other students tests break your code, you will lose points, however since it is a public repo, you can run students tests ahead of time. Lastly, I am also grateful that there was no quiz on Friday! 

### Tip of the week:
Start early and keep up. Really look at the schedule for all of your classes ahead of time. You might just realize that all of your classes have assignments due within a few days of each other.. :)
