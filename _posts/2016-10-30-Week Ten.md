### What did you do this past week?
This past week, I had a few interviews and spent some time working on Phase two of our project.

### What's in your way?
Balancing the time for two projects, tests, interviews, and assessments from companies (as well as my own sanity!).

### What will you do next week?
This next week, I have a test in one of my other classes, a deliverable due for my android class on Thursday, and Phase two of our IDB project due on Thursday as well.

### My experience in the class:
This week, we only had one lecture on Monday where we learned about regular expressions. I feel like the topic really interested the class, as there were a ton of questions asked as we went over the code. I have done a few tutorials related to them, but am definitely not an exert and want to be more comfortable with using them. On Wednesday, we had a tech consulting company, Pariveda, come speak to us about their company and concepts of software engineering. On Friday, it was the 50th anniversary of the UTCS program so we did not have class and were instead encouraged to attend the UTCS 50th symposium. My group used what would have been our class time to get together and work on our project for a bit. 

### Tip of the week:
Make sure you are very comfortable speaking about technologies you put on your resume and review them before interviews. Companies may ask (or even grill you) on specifics of those technologies.
