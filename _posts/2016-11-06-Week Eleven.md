### What did you do this past week?
This past week, most of my time went to working on Phase 2 of our project. We started this phase earlier than we did for the first phase, and in return, ended up finishing a few hours early! 

### What's in your way?
Assignments and tests in other classes. We're nearing the last few weeks of the semester, and almost all of my classes have tests on or near the last week of class (rather than final exams), so I will need to start studying early. 

### What will you do next week?
This next week, my priority will be a project deliverable due on Friday for my Android class. My partner is also in SWE, so we have been working on the IDB project rather than our Android project. Phase 3 of the IDB project has also been released, so my group may want to start working on that this next week.

### My experience in the class:
This week in class, we learned about ways to externalize database information in the forms of XML, JSON, and SQL, all subjects I am familiar with. We started off with simple examples that became increasingly more complex. Something I was unfamiliar with were the pointing systems in XML (provided by DTD and XSD). I was familiar with most of the SQL concepts, such as select statements, joins, and aggregate functions, but definitely need to review subqueries, as they can get quite complicated to read. I wouldn't be surprised if a question on them appeared in our quizzes this next week. 

### Tip of the week:
For Phase 2 of the project, I was tasked with refining the tables for each of the models. We decided to use the JQuery datatables plug in, but ended up having to override most of the functionality (sorting, pagination, next/previous, number of entries). Instead of loading all of our data at once, we wanted to load the data by pages, which our API provided (10 entries per call to our API). Luckily in the end, we were able to get the tables how we wanted them. My advice is again, start early and don't take the easy way out! My group could have loaded all the data right off the bat, but the page would have taken a considerable amount of time to load. Instead, we put in some extra work, and the result was pages with hardly any loading time!
