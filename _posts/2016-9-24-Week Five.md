### What did you do this past week?
This past week, my partner and I finished up the Netflix project (pretty early, actually!) and we met for a few more short sessions just to make sure we did everything right. I also spent some time doing interview prep since our Career Fair was on Tuesday. 

### What's in your way?
Interview prep and finding a job. I feel like there is so much competition and finding a full time job will be much more stressful than finding an internship. 

### What will you do next week?
Next week, my main priorities are interviews and preparing for the upcoming test in this class. In addition, I have a mobile computing assignment due earlier than I expected.

### My experience in the class:
We had another guest speaker, Alex Menzies, come speak to us from the NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) which was pretty awesome. He showed us a demo of how they use Microsoft Hololens to simulate walking on the surface of Mars which blew our minds. Also, I've been doing a lot better on the daily quizzes in this class! I think I've learned how to study for them and hope I can keep it up.

### Tip of the week:
Last semester, I was one of the first people at career fair and was able to skip long lines and visit all the companies I wanted to in about three hours. This year, I arrived around 30 minutes after it started, and lines were already long. I stayed for four and a half hours and still didn't get to speak to all of the companies I wanted to. So be prepared for career fair and **go early!!**
