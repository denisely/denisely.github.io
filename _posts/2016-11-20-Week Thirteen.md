### What did you do this past week?
This past week, I worked on Phase 3 with my group.

### What's in your way?
Right now, only my mediocre studying habits. I easily get distracted or just don't feel motivated to study.

### What will you do next week?
This next week, I will work on the D3 visualization and presentation with my group, since we present the Monday after Thanksgiving break.

### My experience in the class:
This week in class, we continued going over design patterns, which led us into singleton patterns, dynamic binding, and reflection. I have heard some of the terms in previous classes before, but never really understood them. It was nice to walk through examples so we could see how they are used. We also had a talk from Spiceworks. Some of the things I learned is that you should really tailor your resume to the companies you apply for and the positions you apply for, and to leave certain topics (x86 assembly) off, unless you really do know the topic very well. 

My group found that the last phase of our project wasn't very hard at all. The only things really due were the search page and an updated wiki. Since we are presenting the Monday after Thanksgiving, we still have plenty of time to work on our D3 visualization and presentation. 

### Tip of the week:
If you have free time and like Harvest Moon style games, [here is a link](http://store.steampowered.com/app/413150/) to one of my favorite games. The game took [4 years to create](http://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/267563/The_4_years_of_selfimposed_crunch_that_went_into_Stardew_Valley.php) by only 1 developer. He even did all of the art, sounds, songs, etc. by himself, which is pretty inspiring.
