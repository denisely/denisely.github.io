### What did you do this past week?
This past week was definitely more of a relaxing week for me. With only a small assignment due in one of my non CS classes, I took some time to organize myself and recharge. I feel ready to work hard this next week! 

I also met with my with my group a few times to work on Project 3. This is the first time I've worked in a large group (6 people!!) and luckily, we were able to request groups so I'm working with people I've sat with all semester. I'm excited for this project! 

### What's in your way?
I need to spend more time studying the class material. My quiz grades this past week have not been very good.

### What will you do next week?
This next week, I will work more on Project 3 with my group, as well as my Android assignment and project. I also have a test in one of my other classes in about a week and a half, so I will start studying early.

### My experience in the class:
This week in class, we went over Project 3 specs, and some more Python concepts. Project 3 (aka phase 1) involves creating your own version of IDB, and the remaining 2 projects in this class (phase 2 and 3) will be adding more to this website. On the surface, it does not seem too complicated, but once we get to the meat of it, I am sure we will run into more problems. There are also a lot of technologies involved that I am not very familiar with, so I'll need to do some more reading into those. 

Also, the quizzes really kicked my butt this week. I felt like I understood the information, but after actually looking at unfamiliar code and trying to apply that knowledge, I obviously did not fully understand the material. 

### Tip of the week:
Get to know people in class early on! Luckily, I started off knowing one person in class, and from there I met her friends, and they are all now my group members.
