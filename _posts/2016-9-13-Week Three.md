### What did you do this past week?
This past week, I spent most of my time working on assignments. A lot of my assignments across all of my classes piled up in the last week, which was quite stressful. Our first assignment in Software Engineering was also due on Thursday.

### What's in your way?
I still need to learn to manage my time better. I thought I had gotten started on most of my assignments early, but still ended up working until the last minute on some of them because of underestimating how long they would take.

### What will you do next week?
Next week, I will get started on my second project with my partner earlier. I think that having a partner will help avoid procrastinating and help stay on top of things.

### My experience in the class:
The first project took much longer than I expected. The description seemed fairly simple, but since it is our first assignment, we needed to set everything up and just make sure it worked, which took some time. The implementation was not too hard, though I had to figure out Python syntax since I never previously used Python. Now that we have set up the tools and have practiced using the tools, I think the second project will go much more smoothly.

### Tip of the week:
Similar to my tip last week, start early, not just so that you have more time to think about the assignment, but so you have time to go to office hours. Most of my work was within a few days of the deadline, and my availabilitiy did not line up with the remaining office hours for that week.
