### What did you do this past week?
This past week was my hell week. I had a number of assignments due and 2 tests on the same day. I literally just ate, went to class and studied all week. (Notice how I didn't mention sleeping.. yeah it was brutal) 

### What's in your way?
I'm still struggling with time management and planning ahead. Had I really looked at this past week's schedule earlier, I would have realized how many things I had to do, planned accordingly, and started my assignments/studying earlier. 

### What will you do next week?
This next week, I'm hoping to get started on Project 3 and continue applying for jobs! My android class has an assignment due, and final project, so I will be working on those as well.

### My experience in the class:
This test was fair but was a struggle for me, due to poor planning and probably just my own coding abilities. We were definitely given enough time to complete the test, and the testing enviroment was in a large and comfortable room, which was a plus. On first read, the questions seemed confusing, but after skipping around and doing what seemed like the easier ones, you kind of get into "the zone" and fly through the problems. I think now that I have a better idea what the tests are like, I will be able to prepare better for the next one.

Also, we didn't have class the day after the test, which was nice!

### Tip of the week:
Practice coding problems!! I barely used my cheatsheet. You want to be very comfortable with Python and what has been done in class. Thinking back, I am pretty sure I missed a number of semicolons..
