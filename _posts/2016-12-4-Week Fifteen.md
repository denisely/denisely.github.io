### What did you do this past week?
This past week, my group presented our project and I think we did a pretty good job! We also had our last test, which was not too bad at all. Professor Downing told us what topics would be on the test, so I focused on studying for those. I also finished some extra credit for the class: Project 1: Collatz, and an eCIS. In addition, I had an Android project due, and a test in my Management class. 

### What's in your way?
This week was an extremely busy week. Having 2 tests and a project due all on one day was stressful, but I'm glad it's over. 

### What will you do next week?
This next week, I'll still be working on my Android project, since our demo is on Tuesday and then I'll be flying to Atlanta for 2 days. After that, I'll begin studying for my Business Law final.

### My experience in the class:
This week we only had presentations during class. It was interesting to see the other group's websites, since I hadn't really looked through them very much. The other websites looked great! Many of them also included things we realized we should have included in our website. Also, the last test was not too hard. I was much more prepared for it than the first test and didn't need to rush at all. 

I feel like SWE is the most useful class I've taken at UT. I noticed that we learned about some concepts that I had used in my past internships, meaning what you learn in this class is actually applicable to the business world. In addition, I was asked about a number of technologies we learned in this course in interviews this semester. If I hadn't taken this class, I probably would not have been able to answer those questions. 

Overall, it's been a great semester! I met a number of people in this class, learned a lot, and really enjoyed it.
