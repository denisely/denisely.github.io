### What did you do this past week?
This past week, we learned about our second project, Netflix. My partner and I got started fairly early, and I think we have made good progress!

### What's in your way?
I still need to practice programming in Python, creating makefiles, creating unit tests, etc. Right now, I have to refer back to my first project a lot (where we were given starting code) for things such as syntax and organization. I'd like to not necessarily memorize everything, but really just have a better understanding to the point where I won't always need to look off of my old code.

### What will you do next week?
Next week, my partner and I plan to finish the Netflix project early because Career Fair is on Tuesday! I expect to continue doing a lot of interview prep, apply for full time positions, and hopefully get some interviews for full time offers.

### My experience in the class:
One of Professor Downing's past students came to speak to us about the company he currently works for, Bloomberg, and his experience there. He explained to us what they do as a company, which was pretty interesting, and what tools they use. In addition, he gave us some advice on what recruiters look for since he had been recruiting for a few years. 

Overall, it was nice getting to hear from a successful UT alumni. It made me look at the person that I strive to be, which is one that is competent enough to clearly speak and explain about I know and answer questions, as our speaker did.

### Tip of the week:
Practice pair programming!! My partner and I were able to explain to each other suggestions of what to implement in the project, and by doing so, identified possible bugs and additional steps we needed to take.  It's also nice to have someone catch your typos / catch someone else's typos. :)
