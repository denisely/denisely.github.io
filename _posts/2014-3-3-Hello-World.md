### What did you do this past week?
The first week of Software Engineering consisted of going over the syllabus and specific tools we were going to use in the class. I started downloading the necessary software, such as Docker, and also set up this blog.

### What's in your way?
I need to refresh my memory on essential technologies we will be using in class such as Git and Github, and Python. I also still need to get the textbooks that we will be using.

### What will you do next week?
Next week, I will make sure I have all the tools needed for this class, and I will work on getting into a daily routine of coding everyday to hit the estimated 20 hours of required effort per week.

### My experience in the class:
I am very excited for this class, and at the same time, a little nervous. I am usually that person where given the choice of whether to work in pairs or alone on an assignment, I would work alone. I would also never raise my hand in class. Professor Downing's teaching style involves a lot of participation, and he really stresses being social. I feel very intimidated, but this class will force me to get out of my comfort zone which I know in the end will be beneficial to me. My next impression is that this class will probably require the most work out of all the classes I've taken here at UT. I was pretty surprised to see the large number of technologies we will learn. Lastly, I am excited that the professor's teaching style involves walking through code. Going line by line explaining what is going on will really help me understand the code.

### Tip of the week:
I've always been interested in game development, and recently finally took the first steps to get started. Something I started looking into is [Monogame](http://www.monogame.net/), which is an open source implementation of Microsoft's XNA framework with a goal of creating cross platform games. Definitely check it out if you are even slightly interested! There is a great tutorial to help get started.
