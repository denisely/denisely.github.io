### What did you do this past week?
This past week I mostly worked on my Android project, since we had a project deliverable due Friday, and also got started on Phase 3 with my group.

### What's in your way?
I'm still trying to get into a habit of practicing at least one programming question a day, so that I am better prepared for future interviews. 

### What will you do next week?
This next week, I have a test in my Business Law class. Then I will finish up Phase 3 with my group, and work on my Android project.

### My experience in the class:
This week's classes have been kind of slow for me. We talked about refactoring and walked through each step that was taken to refactor a piece of code. It was hard for me to follow along in class probably because the code was long, all the scrolling, trying to process what the professor just said, and trying to focus on the particular part he was talking about. 

I have still been doing poorly on quizzes due to the wording and also misreading them. For example, I misread the column names in two of the quizzes, which costed me points on both. (You'd think I learned my lesson the second time, but under the pressure of the time limit, I totally forgot to double check the column names!) 

Related to Phase 3, my group started a little later than we started Phase 2, but I think we should be fine. We are going to extend our API to do the searching, which the back end team is taking care of. Since I am part of the front end team, I just worked on using React to display the search results (with just some dummy data right now). 

### Tip of the week:
I mentioned this before, but I want to mention it again. Make some friends in class early on so that you'll have a group you enjoy working with. I feel very fortunate to be in the group I am in, because they are very flexibile (its easy for almost all of us to meet in the labs whenever), easy to get along with, and very knowledgeable.
